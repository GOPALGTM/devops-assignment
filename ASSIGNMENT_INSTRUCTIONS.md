# DevOps Assignment

## Overview
You are tasked with analyzing and improving a todo application (React frontend + Node.js backend) to make it production-ready. The application needs to be properly containerized, deployed to Kubernetes, and configured for production use.

## Your Task
You have been given a todo application with its DevOps configuration. Your task is to:

1. **Backend Application** (`backend/server.js`) - Review and improve the backend implementation
2. **Frontend Application** (`frontend/src/App.js`) - Review and improve the frontend implementation
3. **Docker Configuration** (`Dockerfile` files) - Optimize container configuration
4. **Kubernetes Deployment** (`k8s/k8s-deployment.yaml`) - Configure for production deployment

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Conduct thorough code review of all configuration files
- Identify areas for improvement in the application
- Analyze security considerations
- Review containerization and deployment configurations
- Document findings and recommendations

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Implement improvements to the application code
- Optimize Docker configurations
- Configure Kubernetes manifests for production
- Implement proper environment variable usage
- Add production-ready configurations

### 3. Documentation
- Create detailed analysis report
- Explain the reasoning behind each improvement
- Provide recommendations for production deployment
- Document configuration changes
- Include security considerations

## Key Areas to Focus On

### Application Configuration
- Environment variable usage
- Configuration management
- Security considerations
- Error handling

### Containerization
- Docker optimization
- Multi-stage builds
- Security best practices
- Image size optimization

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Resource management
- Security contexts
- Service configuration
- Health checks and monitoring

### Production Readiness
- Scalability considerations
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and recovery
- Performance optimization

## Deliverables

1. **Improved configuration files** with optimizations implemented
2. **Environment variable configuration** for different environments
3. **Analysis document** (`ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`) containing:
   - Detailed analysis of the application
   - Improvements implemented
   - Technical explanations
   - Configuration recommendations
   - Security considerations
   - Production deployment guidelines

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality**: Implementation of best practices
- **Security**: Proper security configurations
- **Container Optimization**: Efficient Docker configurations
- **Kubernetes Configuration**: Proper deployment setup
- **Production Readiness**: Implementation of production-ready configurations
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear explanations and recommendations

## Getting Started

1. **Review the project structure** and understand the application architecture
2. **Analyze the backend** (`backend/server.js`) implementation
3. **Review the frontend** (`frontend/src/App.js`) implementation
4. **Examine Docker configurations** for optimization opportunities
5. **Review Kubernetes manifests** for production readiness
6. **Test your improvements** by running the application locally and deploying to Kubernetes

## Important Notes

- **Production Focus**: Consider this application will be deployed to production
- **Security**: Implement proper security practices
- **Scalability**: Design for scalability and performance
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices for containerization and deployment
- **Documentation**: Document your changes and reasoning

## Assignment Goals

This assignment is designed to test your ability to:
- **Analyze and improve** application code and configurations
- **Implement security best practices** in containerized applications
- **Optimize Docker configurations** for production use
- **Configure Kubernetes** for production deployment
- **Apply DevOps best practices** throughout the application lifecycle

Good luck with your assignment!
